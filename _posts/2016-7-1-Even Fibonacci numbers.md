title: Even Fibonacci numbers, Problem 2
---
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Python 3.0. solved on 2016-7-1

``` python
def fibonacci(until):
    i, j = 0, 1
    k = []
    while i < until:
        k.append(i)
        i, j = j, i+j
    return(k)

def even_valuedCapture(value_set):
    even_value = []
    for value in value_set:
        if value % 2 == 0:
            even_value.append(value)
    return even_value

four_mill = fibonacci(4000000)
result = even_valuedCapture(four_mill)
print(sum(result))
```

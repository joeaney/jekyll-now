# Installation

A quick way to install Jekyll is to follow the installation instructions by David Burela:

Install a package manager for Windows called Chocolatey
Install Ruby via Chocolatey: choco install ruby -y
Reopen a command prompt and install Jekyll: gem install jekyll
For a more conventional way of installing Jekyll you can follow this complete guide to install Jekyll 3 on Windows by Sverrir Sigmundarson.
